from my perspective, it seems like a lot of fans can’t admit when their favorite artists put out subpar or mediocre work. 

i’m not saying that this is true for Drake - i think he really put his best foot forwards towards this beef (AND Pusha T, i think that Duppy Freestyle is often very overlooked) - i just think that K. Dot (and Push) both did MUCH better. 

so - serious question - what makes you think that Drake won?

edit: oops, started discourse

more serious edit: okay. what i’m gathering from these replies is kind of what i expected … i really think that (generally speaking), die hard drake fans are going to praise drake for whatever he says and take his words at face value. i agree that most kendrick fans would do the same with kendrick, but if we look at both of their track records, it seems like kendrick has a more honest track record … drake has been known to lie in the past, this is obvious. from his tracks talking about how he started from the bottom, to denying that he had a son until it was essentially too late to deny it … yeah, if we’re taking rumors at face value, i am much more likely to believe k. dot over drake. 

rumors and gossip to the side … i know that music is subjective… but if we look at all tracks, i think kendrick had the more creative, hard hitting attacks and strategies that dissected drake’s character. it certainly seems like the public perception of drake is changing (even more so than when pusha t went after him, maybe due to the popularity of kendrick’s music).

tl;dr drake fans are siding with drake because he’s drake. nothing else, in my opinion.

I am Trinidadian and I was very proud to see he gave shout-outs to people like Machel Montano and collaborated with artists like Popcaan.

As for the accent, it’s not strictly Jamaican, it’s an amalgamation of different accents from the Caribbean and other locations. It reflects the populations that live in the Greater Area of Toronto, which is where Drake grew up. I’ve been there many times and have heard people speak like that who are not Jamaican or Trinidadian

Lastly, Culture Vultures are exploitative and one sided. Showing appreciation for someone else’s culture and helping it reach new audiences does not make someone a Culture Vulture.

Would people mind offering suggestions for rappers or albums that give similar vibes to Tech N9ne. I'm trying to branch out and having a hard time. 

I have a very large amount of Caucacity. As a result I was never really exposed to much rap. My father hated anything that wasn't Sugar Hill Gang's magnum opus: ""Rapper's Delight"". 

Anyway, I was exposed to Tech N9ne and I absolutely love most of his work. When I've tried branching out I haven't found anyone I like as consistently as tech. His voice, his flows, the way he plays with language and pronunciations, and the different genres he dabbles in makes him really stand out to me. 

Would people mind suggesting rappers like Tech N9ne (even most of the strange music crew doesn't vibe with me which really bums me out) or maybe albums that give off Tech vibes? 

Maybe people don't really like him so maybe this is gonna get me bullied or something but I'm trying to branch out. I also really liked Euphoria, Family Matters, and Not Like Us, but other Kendrick and Drake stuff I've tried hasn't hit me right for some reason.

      However, I didn’t listen to him much at all throughout the 2000’s and early 2010’s. He just didn’t put out anything I wanted to make an effort to find, buy or ask to hear. I wasn’t hearing him being played by anyone anywhere else I went either though. 
       Cut to today’s Busta and I’m Lovin it! I think he’s worked on his flow, bars, etc. most of what he’s dropped in the past 5 years is 🔥 in my opinion. I really am interested to know what the rest of his listeners think bout him, THEN to NOW??

https://www.reddit.com/r/rap/comments/1cwp5yy/why_does_corny_automatically_equal_bad/,"Why does ""Corny"" automatically equal ""Bad""?","  
It's downright baffling how the rap game operates sometimes. It's like there's this unwritten rule that if you don't fit into the stereotype of a tough, streetwise hustler, you're automatically labeled as ""corny"" or ""bad"". But why? Why does creativity and individuality seem to be suppressed under this rigid, narrow definition of what makes a rapper ""legit""? Take someone like Lil Dicky, for instance. Though I'm not really a big fan, the guy's got mad skills, clever wordplay for days, and a unique comedic flair that sets him apart from the crowd. Yet, he's often dismissed as a joke rapper or labeled as corny because he doesn't fit the typical macho image that dominates the rap scene. But why should authenticity be measured solely by how closely someone conforms to a stereotype? Then there's someone like Logic. Here's a dude who raps about real issues like mental health, identity, and social justice. He's transparent about his struggles and uses his platform to inspire and uplift others. But instead of being celebrated for his honesty and depth, he's often criticized for being too ""soft"" or ""preachy"". Why is vulnerability seen as a weakness in an industry that prides itself on authenticity? And don't even get me started on artists like Macklemore or even Childish Gambino. These guys push boundaries, challenge conventions, and refuse to be put in a box, yet they're constantly mocked or dismissed because they don't fit the mold of what a ""real"" rapper should be. It's like we're stuck in this cycle where creativity is stifled, and anyone who dares to stray from the norm is immediately shot down. But who decides what's ""cool"" or ""legit"" anyway? And why do we keep buying into these narrow definitions of authenticity? I'm not saying we should abandon the roots of hip-hop or disregard the struggles of those who came before us. But shouldn't we be celebrating diversity and embracing artists who bring something new to the table? Instead of tearing each other down based on outdated notions of what it means to be a rapper, maybe it's time we start asking ourselves why we're so afraid of anything that doesn't fit neatly into our preconceived boxes.",2024-05-20 16:12:44

But I feel this is gonna backfire on Drake because when kendrick drops the album rumored to be in the works, and his fans search for ""The Heart Part 6"", not only will it bring up Drake's diss, but also recommend or resurface all of the other diss tracks in the beef and remind or introduce the beef to the listener. 

I personally think kendrick should still use the title, yea Drake will get a few streams, but then so will the REAL ""The Heart Part 6"" and maybe a ""Not Like Us"" or ""euphoria"" just because.

There's this revisionist idea that artists ""don't or didn't want smoke"" with Eminem. Artists just don't go after one another unprovoked because that's generally not how rap beefs start. In order for a rapper to diss another rapper (especially elite ones), there would need to be some sort of pre-existing animosity in the air. There have been a few instances where Eminem has gone head-to-head with a skilled opponent, namely Cage, Canibus, and arguably Everlast. With Cage, it was accusations of ""style biting."" With Everlast, it was over a perceived disrespectful interaction with Eminem. With Canibus, there were rumors that Eminem ghostwrote LL Cool J's *The Ripper Strikes Back*.

Eminem, however, never bothered to respond to the diss songs written by Evidence, Esham, K-Rino, Pacewon, or the Game.

I think what's more interesting is that, outside of written diss records, if you look at Eminem's freestyle battle rap record, he's lost to rappers with sharp penmanship, notably Rhymefest, MC Juice, Otherwize, and Doseone (it's important to point out that Eminem had been rapping for almost a decade before participating in Scribble Jam and the Rap Olympics, so he wasn't some fresh-faced beginner in the rap battle circuit).

https://i.redd.it/gd2z8rwd7b1d1.png,Opinions on Rapsody's new album,"I'm a big fan of Rapsody's. I love her style, content, skills, and all of that. But I'm gonna get right to it. This album is disappointing off of the first listen. In terms of rap albums, it's not terrible, but in terms of her previous projects this was... Not the quality she usually gives. 

1. Beats were meh. Her last album might have set a high standard that's hard to keep up with, but aside from 3 AM with Erikah Badu, it was a sonically boring album at first listen 

2. Features? On Eve She had J Cole, GZA, k  Roosevelt, SiR, JID, Queen Latifiah, leikeli47,PJ Morton, Elle Varner, and mareba. They're not the most famous names in rap, but this is a quality stack of features. Every verse was beautiful including hers. I won't say this album's features were bad (Lil Wayne, Baby Tate, DIXSON, Erykah Badu, idk who the rest were tbh. I love phylicia Rashad but she is not a rapper and I'm not including her). Again, I see how following up the last album was hard, but did we try?

3. Content? This was a much more personal album. If Eve was her TPAB (speaking to the community), this album was her MMATBS (a lil heavy on the self depreciation). So that was a little hard to swallow in the first place, but in addition, I don't think she really bared all that needed to be bared. It's like she was trying to be vulnerable, but couldn't quite get it out. 


4. Lyricism and Concept? The bars were there, but they were a little soft compared to what she usually delivers 🫤. I think this was conceptually a little half baked. Not shallow, but not deep either. I hate to say maybe she should have let this stew brew a little longer cause her last album was 2019...

Again, this is just after the first listen. I'll give it a little more, but I already know I'm not going to live this album like the last.",2024-05-19 00:17:51

Alot of people don't know that pimp was a musician. He flipped samples, played the drum machine, keyboards an organs. He produced almost every track on UGKs first 4 albums. He also made beats for tons of other artists like Master P an David Banner. His bread and butter inbetween albums was selling beats that's how he made money.

So where do you rank Pimp C as a producer? I myself put him up there with guys like Dre an Premier. This guy made the beats for classics like ""Diamonds and Wood"" ""One day"" ""Break em off"" ""Pocket full of stones"" an ""Running from the feds"" some of his beats are better then others but tbh I never heard a bad beat that was produced by Pimp C. Everything he made ranged from great to incredible. ",2024-05-19 15:09:23

I hope to use this to highlight some people you might not have thought had bars, confirm your favorite lyricist does have bars and to just have fun and silly bars, all in the name of hip hop!

I have posted some older videos on my channel but now I want to take it more serious and start providing more stats with each song and posting more content constantly. Im curious what you all think and if there are any song you want me to breakdown. I plan on doing new music and old music.

I just released a video this morning for a song off Rapsody's new album! i hope you enjoy and grow with me. I promise it will get better and ill do some editing, i just want to get into the habit of releasing first!

I am far to be a rap addict, but I started to listen some stuff in my car and during my sport sessions, and despite I am very exigent musically, I found some pleasure despite my old age.

I like particularly ""motivational music"".

My favorite rap song is loose yourself from Eminem. Oh my god, even now I listen it at least every month several times (yes, I am a bit obsessional with music: I definitely can listen the same song 2000 times, no problem). 

I thought initially that ""Loose yourself"" was an accident. Until I discovered 4 or 5 months ago NF. Not all songs, but some have a great motivational energy. I dislike NF's songs that are a bit ""romantic"", I prefer either nervous songs or dark songs. Titles I like: Hope (wow), Careful (my n°2), Pandemonium (dark), Suffice, Turn My Back (but it came lately after several listening).

 I'm not english-speaking native, so I don't care of the texts. I like rimes, however. 

My question is: How can I pursue my rap-listener career? 

Any good things I should discover when I say ""motivational artist""?

Youtube & Spotify has been a failure on that.

(And before anyone asks, I am not including Section.80 because Kendrick himself has referred to it many times as a mixtape, and it doesn't feel like an album because it was never supposed to be one, but if you want to include it be my guest. I'm also going to list FATD and FATD: Scary Hours separately)

My list:

Unranked: Black Panther: The Album

Even though this is a great project, I'm unsure how to rank it in the context of this list considering it's more of a compilation album, with some songs not even having Kendrick on them, so I'm choosing not to rank it

  
22. Honestly, Nevermind

He should have said honestly, never mind to this project. The only redeeming quality is Jimmy Cooks. In my opinion, this isn't only Drake's worst album, but it has some of his worst singing performances period.

21. Cole World: The Sideline Story

Every album from this point forward I wouldn't say are bad. But out of all the rest of the albums, this one is definitely the worst. It does have some highlights on it, but overall I rarely ever come back to any of the tracks on here

20. Care Package

This album dropped at a point where I was kind of getting overwhelmed with the amount of Drake music that was coming out, and as a result I didn't really feel excited when this came out. There are definitely some great tracks on here, some of them being 5AM in Toronto, How Bout Now, and 4pm in Calabasas. But there are too many tracks that are pretty boring and just bad for me to rank it any higher

19. Born Sinner

This album sort of does the same thing for me as The Sideline Story except marginally better, I found Cole's first two albums pretty bland and kind of corny, hence the placements

18. Certified Lover Boy

This album is definitely overhated in my opinion, but still one of Drake's worst projects to date. There are some undeniable bangers like Fair Trade and No Friends in the Industry, and some great rapping performances in songs like 7am on Bridle Path and Champagne Poetry. Though there are a lot of bad songs on this record, some of the worst being Girls Want Girls and Way 2 Sexy.

17. Her Loss

When I first heard this album, I really didn't like it. After coming back to it a couple times, there are definitely some undeniable bangers on here, and this album has some of Drake's best rapping performances ever. But with it being a collaboration album, I'm knocking it down a few points because its hard to separate where 21 Savage's influence on the album from Drake's, and I'm trying to solely focus on ""The Big 3"" in making this ranking

16. KOD

J. Cole definitely started to become the rapper we all knew he could be around this time, instead of just making hit records, he actually showed how great his pen game is. Where this album falls flat is his ability to make a good cohesive song while also rapping his ass off, something he wouldn't perfect until later in his career

15. Thank Me Later

Drake's first studio album, and it's definitely a classic. It really let everyone know that Drake is here to stay and that he's a force to be reckoned with, with songs like Over and Find Your Love having such huge impacts. It didn't age as well as some other albums on here, but it changed hip-hop forever and that is undeniable

14. For All the Dogs

Drake's latest album is definitely a mixed bag. On one hand, he has some amazing rapping performances like on 8am in Charlotte, Away From Home, What Would Pluto Do, and First Person Shooter. He even has some great singing performances on songs like Virginia Beach, Slime You Out, and Drew a Picasso. But this album has just as many lows as it does highs, with songs like Calling for You, IDGAF, 7969 Santa, and Gently being absolutely terrible in my opinion

13. Untitled Unmastered

I wasn't really sure where to place this album honestly. It's definitely not my favorite Kendrick project, but it's not terrible. There are some great performances on here but overall I don't go back to this one all that often.

12. Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers

I appreciate him taking a risk with this album, but unfortunately it falls flat for me. There are definitely some great songs on here like N95, Die Hard, Rich Spirit, and Count Me Out, but a lot of the songs just don't hit. I know Kendrick can make deep songs while also making them bangers, but he just doesn't do that on here

11. The Off-Season

J. Cole's best rapping performance on an album yet. This is J. Cole at his peak no doubt about it. This is when he started to make great songs where he also displayed his incredible lyrical ability. If I was just ranking the albums based on that, this would be his highest ranking album. Unfortunately, where this album lacks is it's impact on the culture. It's his lowest selling album other than KOD, and it didn't really stick with people the way I thought it would when I initially listened to it. 

10. Scorpion

Coming right after his loss to Pusha T, Drake definitely had a lot to say on this record. And say a lot he did. Although this album definitely has some low lows, it also has some of his biggest highs to date. Songs like God's Plan, Nice for What, and In My Feelings completely dominated the lives of everyone. You couldn't go anywhere or go on any social media without hearing these tracks. Everyone from babies to your 100 year old next door neighbor were singing ""Kiki, do you love me?"" Not only that, Drake has some great rapping performances on here with songs like Elevate, Emotionless, Mob Ties, and Can't Take a Joke. Overall, one of Drake's albums in recent years.

9. 4 Your Eyez Only

J. Cole's attempt at a concept album, and he definitely delivered. Whether or not he delivered a gourmet meal or Mcdonald's is up for debate. Overall, it definitely isn't on the level of a Kendrick concept album but he definitely made a solid effort and showed he could do it. He definitely hones in on some serious topics and raps pretty well throughout the record. Although it isn't my favorite Cole album, I can definitely see why some people consider it a classic and praise it so much, and it definitely made an impact.

8. Views

The impact this album had is undeniable. You couldn't go anywhere without hearing Hotline Bling, One Dance, Controlla, Too Good, etc. It's definitely one of Drake's best R&B performances ever, and left a huge mark on the genre as a whole.

7. 2014

J. Cole's definitive classic album. Outsold all his albums by a mile, and it's easy to see why. Wet Dreamz and No Role Modelz were absolutely huge, they were definitely anthems of the 2010s. This shot J. Cole into the mainstream, and without it he probably would've never made it into this ""Big 3.""

6. FATD: Scary Hours

This record has some of, if not the best, Drake rapping performances ever. This showed me and the whole world that he still has an amazing pen game and can rap at the highest levels. After so many mid records, this was much needed. Every single song on this project is amazing, and I really hope we get more of this in the future.

5. TPAB

Undeniably a classic album, but it isn't my favorite Kendrick album. There are some shortcomings on this record, mostly its replayability to me personally, but I can't deny the genius of this album. This is what J. Cole wanted to do with 4 Your Eyez Only. A concept album full of great rapping performances.

4. Take Care

Drake's sophomore album did not disappoint at all. Nobody will ever be able to emulate the impact that this had, being by far the best selling album on this list. Everything from Headlines to Take Care to Marvins Room is just incredible. He even gave Kendrick Lamar his own track on this album, giving a huge boost to his career. Undeniable classic.

3. DAMN.

All I can say about this album is damn. Incredible project front to back. Kendrick's unmatched when it comes to being able to make a story-telling album while also having it filled with bangers. Just a masterpiece through and through.

2. Nothing Was the Same

Drake's greatest album in my opinion. His best rapping performances ever come from this album. From Tuscan Leather to Furthest Thing to Started from the Bottom to Wu-Tang Forever to Worst Behavior to Hold on, We're Going Home to Pound Cake / Paris Morton Music 2 I could go on and on listing great tracks from this album. Not many people can say they have 3 classic albums in a row.

1. Good Kid, M.A.A.D City

I don't think I even need to explain this one. Not only is it Kendrick's best selling album, it's full of his best performances ever. Undeniably one of the best albums to ever grace the genre.

He really does live and breathe this music shit.

For so, so, so many years now, for better or worse, he has given absolutely everything he has to try to keep his spot as the top artist. Unlike many other rappers (this might not necessarily be a good thing) being a music artist is truly his LIFE. We all joke about the cosplay thing which is totally true, but the fact that he really just lives this rap/music lifestyle to the max and just keeps finding ways musically to stay on top is…. Wild.

I get that people change and I try not to judge music taste because it's so subjective. Is he just making what he wants to with no regard to sales or popularity? Even a 21 Savage feature couldn't save Psilocybae for me. Little Foot Big Foot sounds like a Kidz Bop version of a song about selling drugs. Donald grew up in the suburbs and went to art school I'm pretty sure he never sold coke.

2. the intensity in Kendrick's tone even though he wasn't even really rapping intensely until the end
3. This was the moment I felt it was bigger than hip hop

Then, ""Not Like Us"" dropped...and it was the complete opposite.

I was hyped and laughing and dancing. The irony is, Not Like Us is actually a more biting song lyrically if you were to just read the words on paper, until you get to the call and response at the end.",2024-05-16 22:21:42

Just an honest question. In the beef I am team Kendrick but I will admit I’ve never willingly, purposefully even listened to Drake. So while I love Dot, I admit 100% that my opinion on this beef is biased.

As far as my experience with Drake so far: I remember when “Hotline Bling” was popular and I thought it was a boring song. Any time I hear Drake, his voice sounds sleepy, the flows are nothing crazy, the lyrics don’t really hit me. He has just never been my thing, I’ve never understood his popularity.

But he’s obviously been very successful. So, can any genuine Drake fans please recommend me the songs or albums that prove Drake’s quality, or just explain what it is you like about his music.

To help you out: I do admit he’s got some skill, his verse on “Forever” is solid, even if I mainly listen to that song for Em and Wayne’s verses. But I think Drake’s verse is good. It still didn’t make me want to hear more.

As far as other rap and hip hop goes, I like Wayne, Kanye (esp. first five albums), Em, Kendrick, Jay-Z, of course Pac and Biggie, Nas—basically I enjoy and appreciate the work of most big names in the genre, but nothing about Drake has ever appealed to me. And I listen to a lot of music, from rap to folk to classic rock to T-Swift and Olivia Rodrigo. I am a musician myself and I appreciate all forms of music. Drake just simply does not hit for me, nothing I’ve heard has ever made me want to listen to him.

This is not a troll post. I’m being serious. He’s one of the top-charting artists for a reason, so give me that reason people. What track do I need to hear to understand why Drake is as big as he is? 

Can’t promise y’all my mind will change but I do promise to listen to your suggestions and try to keep my mind open. As a music fan I want to appreciate one of the most successful artists of this era, so please give me genuine recommendations and no hate. I’m just trying to get perspective on an artist I simply have not connected with. I will give the music an honest chance and see if my feeling changes.",2024-05-16 21:05:40

1946, is the year it all commenced,   
The war was very brutal, the trenches very tense

since mexico left that state

Casualties are everywhere, thats such a freaking bore.  
 Those who want to come back but couldnt

https://www.reddit.com/r/rap/comments/1ctpooj/striking_similarites_between_nasjayz_beef_and/,Striking similarites between Nas/Jayz beef and this kendrick/drake battle,"The Nas and Jay Z beef is eerily similar to this one. 

Nas, like kendrick, was seen as the more authentic and pure artist. The artist the ""culture"" backed and championed. 

Jay Z, like drake, was seen as a sellout due to him pandering to a more commercial audience. Also, was being attacked by a slew of artists who he addresses on takeover.

Takeover imo was the better record, going at everybody that was coming at him and hitting nas with harder hitting disses. This is similar to family matters, drake goes at everybody, and comes with the better disses. 

Nas retaliates with ether, which was considered soo good that it became a verb and seen as one of the greatest disses of all time. A lot of ether was lies and just vulgar insults like not like us and MTG. However, since the ""culture"" and public opinion backed nas more, they said he won. the only difference is that not like us is a hit record, which ether was not, but all of the claims on the record are false and just plain out vulgar insults. 

MTG would be a good diss if any of the claims were real, but was a failed story of adidon. The strategy was dope, because even if its fake, the people for the time being would be distracted from the claims on family matters. 

Nas' career was also in its twilight, but ether gave him a 2nd wind. Likewise, kendricks last album only sold 230k first week, which is abt half of what he sold on gkmc, damn and tpab first week. Kendrick was slowly fading and this gave him a 2nd wind as well imo.

Drake and Jay lost because the public wanted to see goliath fall and be dethroned as the number 1. They had too many enemies and due to the industry championing another artist, they weren't able to overcome public perception. In other words, Jay and Drake weren't likeable due to their cocky personas whereas kendrick and nas were championed due to their likeability and authenticity.",2024-05-16 18:23:29

Making personal attacks is just weird. Just hit the downvote/upvote button to show your opinion if you're not interested in engaging intellectually 

People go at Drake for THP6 but completely accept that Kendrick is pushing claims that have zero base. This is just an example of the reality that people will mindlessly believe anything if it aligns with whatever narrative they want. Let's have a look at the facts: Drake hid his kid and he had a campaign rollout for the public announcement

Drake was not in a LTR with the mother of his child. Meaning the responsible thing to do is to have a paternity test, especially when the kid comes out with blonde hair and blue eyes. After that it makes sense to focus on your family dynamic and figuring out how you're going to coparent 

Any assessment of Drake's ability to be a father should be based on how he treats his kid. Anyone claiming that he should tell the world is exposing that they have some weird obsession and entitlement and ironically simultaneously demonstrating why he made the best decision 

Yes, celebrities monetise their child announcements. What do you think the photoshoot Instagram posts are about? Or the magazine front cover and article? Or whatever other way they do it. Even if he had something with Adidas lined up that makes him a good businessman not a bad father lol

In the end there's zero evidence for Drake being a deadbeat or absent or even slightly bad father. Which is why the reaction to THP6 really exposed people's biasedness",2024-05-16 17:09:46

","If you aren't familiar with the title, a large portion of guitar-heads consider [Prince's ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" solo](https://youtu.be/dWRCooFKk3c?t=200) to be the greatest guitar solo of all time, not solely due to technical ability or showmanship, but a combination of everything that makes a guitar solo great.

When it comes to hip-hop/rap, what is the greatest individual performance of all time? Maybe even if we all disagree on the answer, we can help each other find some new great stuff.

I was making a tier list for best lyricists of all time, and there was a LOT of amazing artists, so I did mess up on a few, such as accidently placing Kendrick Lamar under J. Cole. So, he told me that Kendrick is too low.

Anyways, SOMEHOW this turned into a ""90s rap vs modern rap"" thing, in which he took the side of modern rap. And this man isn't stupid, he's probably one of the wisest man I know. But that's not the point.

So basically, I was explaining to him how I just found 90s rap to be more enjoyable, due to their advanced lyricism and more simple although reliable beats and flow. To show him this, I sent him a picture from a Big L song, one of my favorites, ""The Enemy."" In which, he replied with some Kendrick Lamar song (since I'm not a Kendrick FAN FAN, I'm not sure which he referred to.)

So then this got me thinking: With Kendrick Lamar in beef currently, and with his actual ""full power"" now out in the public, could he truly defeat Big L in both a diss track and lyricism in general? These are two questions. Just curious on your guy's opinions.",2024-05-15 17:54:52

One thing I've never been asked, but I've started to wonder about myself lately:  both genres, at the beginning, were considered ""black music,"" but by the time Jazz was as ""old"" as Rap - around the 1970's, there were a fair amount of prominent white artists active.  Fifty years on from the inception of Rap, that doesn't seem to be the case, not as much as it was with Jazz.  There are obviously a few big ones, but a white rapper is still noteworthy, at least in my opinion.

I wonder why that is?  I hope it's clear, I'm not trying to tee up a big racial fight, and I'm certainly open to the idea that it has something to do with some kind of prejudice in our culture.  But I point out to the kids during the Jazz unit, it was considered ""degenerate music"" until about the time white kids started playing it, then suddenly it started to be looked upon more favorably by ""polite"" (read: white) society, and by the time the 70's rolled around, Jazz was being taught in school band classes, and the perception it was something only black people played was all but gone.  Not so much with Rap, I'd argue.

Also how he exploited kendricks rocky relationship, being away from his kids etc and living in NY, and how his Girl has yet to say anything @ all about the whole situation lol.

Euphoria was hard, felt like a crazy pre-game of what was to come. Instead we got MTG which had the fake daughter thing and a NLU, which is kinda a meme/tik tok song and not a lyrical massacre. If it was any other artist I think the internet would have received those tracks somewhat differently

Anyways, back to my point, I understand the general consensus is that Kdot won and I can obviously agree with that, but with that said, I thought Drakes tracks overall were reasonably solid and nothing to sneer about. It felt as though, coming into this, people had already made up their minds about which way this was gonna go and have reacted accordingly. 

Perhaps it's my perspective as a Brit who can appreciate a particularly dry sense of humour but I appreciated the angle Drake initially took with his disses (especially the us of AI). His word play was fun and flow was good in push ups and Taylor made. 

Contrasting to this, Kendricks directness/forwardness basically saying that he hated him and wanted him dead just didn't really sit with me all that well. I understand a diss is meant to be personal but at the same time, lyrics like that just weren't of that much interest to me. Euphoria and meet the Grahams almost felt like they could be elongated tweets rather then actual songs.

Anyways I just think that a lot of people are sheep here and follow the herd on whatever the ring leaders thoughts and feelings are.

Everyone knows a Sexxy Red (I had a girl like her in my middle school lmfao). Her music has that traditional southern/trap beat and her voice feels ""classic"" in that way. She's also so over the top and ridiculous that you can tell it's supposed to be art. Glorilla is the hardest of them all and has some legit bangers, same appeal as Sexxy Red but more polished and cool. They both have music that reminds me of trashy fun hood bangers like ""Whoot There It is"" (the original) or ""Daisy Dukes"".

Ice is the worst of them all, the most aggressively pushed, the lamest voice, and unrelatable to the black community tbh. She also doesn't have a personality and instead goes for a brainless sex robot style which is extremely bland but gets hella push cause porn addicted dudes lowkey go more wild over a brainless bimbo type than a sexy confident or sexy ratchet woman.

I searched Reddit and the rest of the internet and the outrage about this feels...tepid. In fact, the reddit threads were mostly thinking that the track was lame for using AI (I agree) but not overly upset that Drake seemingly used other artist's voices without any permission in the first place.

Why aren't consumers and artists themselves completely up in arms about this? Are they and I'm just not searching the right places? I read one short interview with Snoop about this and his reaction was essentially,  ""meh.""

If I was him I'd have been on the phone with my lawyers IMMEDIATELY (I don't have the first clue on any relationship between Drake and Snoop but even if theyre best friends I would still be like what the fuck).  I did see Tupac's estate threatened a lawsuit pretty quickly but if this AI shit isn't nipped in the bud the entire music industry (among others) is going to suffer some major problems in the immediate future.

Big L would have been on the Mt. Rushmore of rap, and would have been as famous as Em or Pac.

Jay Z has some of the best beats from the 90's - early 200's, from Can't knock the hustle to Dead Presidents to Song cry. Also, Ether is more lyrically potent than Takeover, but the beat on Takeover is way better and it generally sounds better. Most of the time I'd rather hear Takeover, and I love Nas.

Russ is WILDLY overhated. Not just has the dude had an amazing career so far, but he's given so much game back to independent artists and deserves much more love than he gets.

J Cole isn't bad, but sounds very generic and is almost like a watered down version of ""conscious"" hip hop. Half of his ""deep"" lyrics sound like something a 14 year old would share on facebook. He has a few songs I like, but is certainly not one of the greats.

RA the Ruggedman is one of the best skill wise and dropped the best hip hop album of 2020.

Kendrick Lamar doesn't sound good on features, and his disses were lyrically great but didn't sound very good musically.

Diamond D is a one of the best producers, up there with Premier.

Yelawolf is severely underrated and is one of the best artists in the game. Love story is amazing.",2024-05-14 07:56:59

Westleys Theory: I think its the best song representing the theme of TPAB. So much thing happens in the song but they all fit perfectly just like the album cover. ""Are you really who they idolize? To Pimp a Butterfly"" is giving me chills and i guess one of best ways to start an album.



Stillmatic (The Intro): I love Stillmatic. Not saying its as good as Illmatic and It Was Written but still a fire album. And the Intro is a great opening for the album. Fire verse from Nas as always


Premonition: Lot of people will not agree with me but i think Ems best intro is Premonition. Showing us the theme of MTBMB with Alfred Hithcocks voice and a nice hook that fits into 1900s horror movies. Just like Westleys Theory ""Its Music To Be Murdered By"" part gives me chills. Pretty fire verse and nice wordplays on that song



Good Morning: I miss the old Kanye. Jokes aside never been a Kanye fan but Graduation is one of my fav albums. Just like Westleys Theory and Premonition the part he says Graduation gives me chills again. The song is pretty fire and the beat/lyrics is just a little version of the whole Graduation imo.

I also happen to be a professional musician with a masters degree from a top music school and a composer. So I'm here to explain Drake's B Sharp thing because people that took elementary piano lessons are suddenly experts in music. Once again, I preface that I'm team Kendrick, and I still think Drake lost and his last track sucked, but not for the MBB shit, the Epstein shit, or this B Sharp shit. Track is just ass. Anyways.

Thesis: THERE IS A FUCKING B SHARP NOTE. IT IS NOT THE SAME AS C.

Let me go back to fundamental music theory. There are 7 letter names/notes, and 12 pitches. The pitch is what you hear. The letter name and note is what you call it. I distinguish the two for reasons I will get to.

Look at this keyboard: [https://pianosecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/x1-Octave-Labled.gif.pagespeed.ic\_.NpMj6GVr3p.png](https://pianosecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/x1-Octave-Labled.gif.pagespeed.ic_.NpMj6GVr3p.png)

It is a small section of a piano keyboard that contains all 12 notes in one octave. After one octave, the notes repeat, just at a higher pitch. The song ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" has the interval of an octave at the start of the melody ""Somewhere"". The higher pitch is the same note, at a higher octave.

So, you'll see in the keyboard there are 7 notes in the white keys, CDEFGAB and then C again. On the black notes you see two names such as C#/Db. These notes are called enharmonic notes, because they have to be called something different depending on context. There is a thing called the circle of fifths that explains how many sharps and flats are in certain keys, so if you hear someone say ""this song is in D major"" you can reference the circle and see that the key has two sharps. Sharps are always assigned in order of F# C# G# D# A# E# B#. So if you're in D major, and the key has two sharps, your D major notes will be D E F# G A B C# D, it has two sharps and we assigned them in the order above. Likewise with flats, there is an order - Bb Eb Ab Db Gb Cb Fb. So a key such as Bb with two flats will be Bb C D Eb F G A Bb - we assigned two flats in the order above. Back to enharmonic notes, one thing is that the black notes are not the only notes with enharmonics. All notes have enharmonics, and as has been discussed, B#/C are enharmonic. Fb/E are also enharmonic, Dx (double sharp) is enharmonic to E as well.

An important thing about scales is that all scales must have one of each letter name. So if you're playing a D major scale as outlined above, you can't have D E F Gb G A B C# D. There's a repeated G note, even though the Gb and F# pitches are the same.

Based on all those rules, in the key of C#, what is the 7th note? B#. C# D# E# F# G# A# B#. Note, that there is also an E# in this key, which is another white key note that is equivalent to another white key note (E#/F are enharmonic).

So, in summary, B# and C have the same pitch, that's to say, they \*sound\* the same, but B# and C, musically, mean completely different things and both exist and do things independent of each other.

Before you say that C# is an uncommon key, not it's not. Pieces might often not \*start\* in C#, as commonly as keys like C, F, G, Bb, D, etc, but music typically modulates, and a lot of times music WILL move to the key of C# and you will often see the pitch B# written.

But for a very obvious example, here is BACH's Prelude and Fugue in C# Major from the Well Tempered Clavier.

Stop talking out of your asses, this goes to everyone including Joe Budden and his podcast.

Edit: someone's gonna call me a nerd, I can even predict your angles.

Edit2: BTW, this is not me saying the line isn't corny. It's extremely corny. It's like if someone did a diss line about relativity and someone responded ""nuh uh cause if E= MC squared I'm E cause I'm the MC but you're the square one and by the way quantum physics is my definition because I exist in two planes at once and here are 3 more formulas that have nothing to do with anything I'm saying"". It's corny because it's corny and he sounds like a try hard. The A minor line was simple, to the point, and funny.

Edit3: Rather than comment on everyone that posts some dumb shit here - I'll put it this way, in a G major triad, you have the notes G B and D. B is the third. In a G# major triad, what would the third be? Depending on your answer I'll know you're an idiot.",2024-05-13 14:06:32

He didn't even bother to go at the easy shots by waving away the Ghostwriting allegations at the beginning. Just a single bait out and a supercharged tea shot that went low as fuck.

Also, as an artist myself, I go and find artwork and references to pull off from and create my own thing. There’s nothing new under the sun, art is everywhere and if you think you created something different and fresh, it was always inspired by something old.

Drake could have kept this momentum going indefinitely and he very well could've been a billionaire just by doing this, in addition to any other streams of revenue he's generated over the years. 

What Kendrick did, thoughts on him aside, was the most cutthroat and vicious thing a person could do to a person they hate: completely tore apart his reputation and character. Right now, for the first time in years, Drake actually has to sit up and start playing things strategically and more carefully now. If Drake's next album flops or isn't the hardest fucking bars that hip-hop hasn't heard in decades in addition let alone to anything he's previously put out, it'll mark the beginning of his decline. 

And while right now Kendrick is still riding the high of taking down the Goliath, it's not like it'll help him long-term either. Kendrick, ironically, might start to decline as well, tbh.

Both are in the genre that blends hip hop into pop and both have made songs that have reached huge mass appeal. Pharrell and the Neptunes are on another level though. Pharrell’s impact, on hip hop specifically, has been long lasting and covered a broader range of work. Pharrell produced tracks are essentially a who’s who of artists and hits from the late 90’s to the late 2010’s. This includes the track that really originated the beef, by extension, “What Happened to that Boy”.

Family Matters is actually Drake’s best offering in the beef and a decent song. Damn if that line doesn’t set me off every time I hear it though. Drake isn’t in Pharrell’s level and his importance to the movement isn’t close.",2024-05-11 18:54:32

https://www.reddit.com/r/rap/comments/1cpo8zj/hey_another_kdot_post_this_one_is_asking_opinions/,"Hey, another Kdot post!  This one is asking opinions on his voice and some of his disses. ","Off the bat, I wasn’t a huge fan of either, initially. Drake had some fine pop hip-hop songs, but neither had gotten my attention very often. I’m a standard old head, almost passed rap as a daily listen now. More podcasts and comedy on the drive. After this past week of fire though…

Drake is still listen-ably mid, but not looking good right now. Kendrick, at least at times, apparently makes some of the best music I’ve heard in 20 years. I’m really just trying to have two points of discussion though - 1. I’ve tried to talk to the youths in my life about the beef and the artists. None of them much care for Kdot, all bc of his voice. It is definitely different, and I can understand where they’re coming from. I think my kid may come around, hopefully. I told my neph to ask his gf her thoughts, bc I think he may get a different perspective. I was honestly surprised he was a pretty big Drake fan. He turned me on to Cole a while back on a road trip together, and I introduced him to some old Snoop, Kane, Cube, and Black Sheep he’d never heard. I’m just wondering what others opinions of Kendrick’s voice is. I’m cool with it now, but he’s def not gifted with a Nate Dogg sound or whatever. 

Question 2. - as much as I love “Not Like Us”, the lines about Freaky ass ** and 69 God are a little odd to me. Same as the whole “whip your lovin on me” by Harlow. Anywhere 15-30 years ago, you couldn’t waterboard me into saying “I’m vanilla baby” or proclaiming my love for missionary. Saying “I’m freaky and a 69 God” would also sound like standard boasts in a song, not insults. I understand the intention by Kendrick is taking shots at Drakes creepy behavior, and that’s cool. The song is outstanding. I’m not even criticizing those lines I guess, just pointing out I think they’re being taken so well and ran with bc overall the song is fire, and Kendrick killed him.

Blue Lips (Schoolboy Q)- 89/100
Very good album, i liked the production a lot, and the Freddie, Devin Malik, Lance Features. I couldn’t give it a 90 because of Rico Nasty’s verse on Pop. I feel like her voice didn’t really fit the song and she sounded weird. Favorite Track: First

Alfredo (Freddie Gibbs, The Alchemist)- 90/100
Amazing project. The Alchemists’s production really makes the album unique imo, The Alchemist is one of my favorite producers oat,  and i really liked Freddie’s rapping and lyrics, and the features by Rick Ross, Benny The Butcher and Tyler. Fav song: Something to Rap About

The Carter 4 (Lil Wayne)- 92/100
Amazing album. The thing i loved about this album is the variety and the lyrics. I loved the features, classic album. Favorite song: Outro

Revival (Eminem)- 30/100
I got this recommended in my PM’s by some user which i won’t mention. I didn’t like this project because of the features and literally everything else. Ed Sheeran? Beyonce? On an Em album? Weird. Only song i liked is Chloraseptic. Eminem fell off after this project. Let’s hope the next one is better.",2024-05-11 09:13:57

Kendrick has three options here, have an actual mole that Drake didn’t know about, have a double agent Drake though was working for him, or have a fake mole that purposefully posted items that were not Drakes. This leads Drake to think he has the advantage and make a power move by claiming to have planted the evidence himself. Either way Drake loses because no matter what Kendrick controls the move and catches Drake Red-handed in a lie.

https://www.reddit.com/r/rap/comments/1covwd5/which_rappers_actually_have_a_nicesounding_voice/,Which rappers actually have a nice-sounding voice?,"I've been following the latest beef even though I don't really listen to either of the artists involved, it's just too titillating. It's reminded me that I can't stand either of their voices. 

But then I thought about it, and I can think of very few rappers whose voices don't have some downsides to them. Even the ones I listen to regularly, I'm just used to their voice from exposure. 

The difference in abrasive vocal quality between Kanye West and Lil Wayne isn't Sinatra vs some homeless guy on the street. I just tolerate one over the other because I prefer his music. 

There are plenty of threads talking about rappers whose voice people can't stand, so this is the opposite of that. I want your opinions on rappers whose voices most people find appealing. 

I've eliminated Drake, Kendrick, Kanye, Eminem, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg (kind of), Lil Wayne (with prejudice), Nicki Minaj. Some of these people I listen to but if I look at it outside that lens their voice isn't a good quality. 

That leaves Rick Ross, Ice Cube, and Nate Dogg. The last one exclusively because of his chorus on Shake That. 

Who else?

EDIT: I've seen plenty of people comment about Kid Cudi. I didn't think of him when making this, but I include him in my short list of good voices.",2024-05-10 14:03:16

Could AI write a song that'll fool even an artists biggest fans?,"Drake: Yeah, sippin' on my feelings, pouring out my heart, In this game of life, I'm just playing my part, From the 6ix to the world, I rep where I'm from, Every beat that I touch, yeah, I leave it numb.Started from the bottom, now I'm living large, But the memories of struggle, they still in charge, Got my eyes on the prize, never losing sight, In this endless pursuit, every day, every night.Stacking up the wins, but I've felt the pain, Every loss, every scar, it's all in the game, I keep pushing forward, ain't no looking back, In this marathon of life, I'm staying on track.Got my circle tight, loyalty above all, Through the highs and the lows, they never fall, Riding with me, through the highs and the lows, In this world of fakes, they're the realest I know.So I'll keep chasing dreams, reaching for the stars, With my heart on my sleeve, and these bars, Drizzy in the building, can't nobody deny, I'm the king of this game, until the day I die.

Kendrick: In the city of Compton, where the streets tell tales, Every corner's a story, every voice prevails, From the block to the booth, I spit truth in my rhymes, Painting pictures of struggle, in these modern times.Raised on Section 8, where dreams were a rarity, But I turned pain into power, with my clarity, Flow so intricate, like a maze in my mind, Every word, every line, reflects the grind.From ""good kid"" to ""m.A.A.d city,"" I've seen it all, From the pain of my people, to the rise and the fall, But through it all, I stand tall, never compromised, In this world full of lies, I'm the voice of the wise.With every verse I spit, I'm breaking chains, Empowering the voiceless, easing their pains, So listen close, as I speak from the soul, Kendrick Lamar, forever in control.

","I pulled up to a red light in my city that is notoriously long. Fatter than biggie. 4min+ light since it's a busy intersection. Good thing I had my hip-hop playlist handy, and just as I pulled up ""Like That"" came on. I turned it to 5/50 volume and turned my bass down to 4/20 (nice) as well. I'm not an asshole, I save the bass boosting for cruising on the freeway and back roads. 

Anyways, I could see this lady in front of me. White woman, probably late 70's being generous, she was scowling through the rearview mirror. I was like, ""really can she hear the bass?"" So I turned it down more, and I could barely hear the golden bars. I continued to see her look back at the road, the mirror to back at me. 

So then she scooted up forward into the crosswalk, when people were walking and blocking pedestrians from crossing. At that point I knew what to do. 

Somebody, probably the ghost of Drake's career, rolled the sunroof down, turned up my bass to 15/20 and the overall volume to 40/50. I don't know who made that choice, but it was \*for sure not me.\* 

For the next three minutes I watched in glee as this woman was in frantic horror at was playing behind her. I loved it. I love being a public nuisance, I don't condone it but oh boy do I love it. That lady looked like she was in the shower scene from psycho at some good bass hitting her crosswalk encroaching ass. 

When the light finally turned-- this boomer \*flew\* into a left turn, practically on two wheels, then hit it at what I figure is 80+ down the road to get away from me. I was just laughing-- like imagine having that obscene a reaction at rap that you endanger others around you and yourself. 

Anyways-- I'll attempt to experiment further if this song is the key, or purely any loud bass boosted nonsense will trigger them... results may vary.

Kendrick uses several different voices and raps on this weird 4 bar cadence for part of it. Idk man i love the flow, i love the weird beat switches. Its just really unique whereas everything drake put out sounded like something else i’ve heard a million times. 

Like drake has some bangers but the first time you hear those songs is the best time. Like you understand it immediately, its the sugar of rap. A lot of Kendricks stuff gets richer the more you listen to it. At first youre like “whats the fuck” and then as you absorb it its a much more interesting experience, like a gormet dish with some weird bitter flavors and some spice youve never heard of, and it expands your tastes.

His rapping is better on Heart pt 6, family matters just felt like a low energy and low effort pop song.

Hell at our local mom and pop restaurants the old folks are discussing it and picking sides. So now that they have the attention , whether they were looking or it or its a ramification of the cow, what next? Could they use this as a positive to address beef with the country? I mean how cool would it be for this beef to not end up like Biggie and Pacs tragic demise and be known as the beef that changed the world for the good.

Drake started the beef with Push Ups which then got 2 responses : Euphoria and 6:16 In LA. In both tracks Kendrick begs him to keep it friendly because he knows a lot of shit about Drake.

At this point Drake has 2 options for his response : keep it hiphop or get personal. For some reason, he thought making it a personal beef would be better. I don't know if it's because he thought Kendrick was bluffing or because he thought his red button was more dangerous, but it just doesn't make sense for him to make this decision. Worst case scenario in a purely hiphop rap beef is people acknowledge you as a worse rapper than Kendrick which most people already do. You essentially have all to gain and nothing to lose in a purely hiphop beef, whereas making it personal puts you under the risk of having your brand and public image getting damaged. 

Now I know if you're as big as Drake, you probably have enough ego to think you won't we touched. BUT MF THIS HAS ALREADY HAPPENED TO YOU. A guy has already hurt your image in the same way. You'd think that this would help Drake learn from his mistakes and approach this differently.

https://www.reddit.com/r/rap/comments/1co5qjo/my_perspective_on_why_kendrick_won_the_feud_so_far/,My Perspective On Why Kendrick Won The Feud (So Far),"**This will be very long so the TLDR is at the bottom.** For now it, seems like the feud has settled down, and while we might get more responses , I think Kendrick has won. I'll admit I did have a Kendrick bias going into this battle, and while Drake did hold his own, he lost for multiple reasons. 

**Skills:** Drake is a good rapper, who has great hooks and witty bars that can stick with you. He definitely flexed a bit with Family Matters which has his best rapping to date. However, Kendrick is superior in this category as his verses were more complex with better delivery, cadence, metaphors and entendres.  While both showed a wide range of flows, Kendrick showed more versatility as his flows on all his diss songs were very distinct; Kendrick's songs also sounded vastly different from each other. The bar for Drake was definitely set lower here, but just because he did better than expected doesn't mean he showed he is a better rapper (he didn't btw). 

**Public Image/Reputation/Credibility:** I don't think they could contrast each other anymore. Drake is a personality who lives a party lifestyle and is very much out here, versus Kendrick who is a lowkey family man who can be seen as a recluse understandably. As far as Kendrick goes, you do not hear much about him....like at all, outside of his music. He does make headlines, but there's no salacious activity associated with him. Because of this, people would be hard pressed to judge him outside of his music and the interviews he gives. 

I think Drake's lifestyle kind of worked against him here. He definitely can be seen as a Mr.Bitches type (Playa Playa), and has made headlines for who he's dating. However he also has made headlines for the controversial situations he put himself in, who he's aligned himself with and questionable verses. Hell he even comes off as feminine/sassy at times which can be a negative for a male in hip-hop.  A very specific example of his reputation being called into question are his seemingly random disses to Meg the Stallion and Rihanna; in the latter case he comes off as bitter/jaded years after they split. In the past, he has also to lie about things (ie. His son at first), so it's understandable for one to question his truthfulness

I'm by no means saying that the allegations made by Kendrick and Drake are true, but because of Drake's reputation, people listening could be swayed into believing what Kendrick has said. And because Kendrick hasn't given anyone a reason to doubt him or question his character he comes off as more believable. I honestly think people would sooner believe Drake peruses very young women than Kendrick putting hands on his wife/partner. 

  
**Culture-** This is probably the biggest reason why I think Drake lost maybe even before the battle began. To Drake's credit, he has been HEAVY in music, dropping consistently, whether by himself or with others.  He definitely has done numbers that we didn't even think would be possible for a rapper to do, however because of his public perception he is more infamous than popular. When Drake drops projects often times his verses and songs are memed at his expense. I cannot count the amount of content I've seen of Drake perceived as feminine, coward like, or straight childish.  

To top it off, Drake **NEVER** speaks on black issues in his music. This isn't to say that he doesn't care about black issues, as he himself has said he would rather do than say; he made headlines donating to black causes. But because of his perceived silence to these issues in his music, listeners could say that he is out of touch with issues in the black community;  specifically black American. And before you question this, rappers preach that they rap about their lives. If you never rap about it, how can you say you lived it or is something you care about?

Kendrick on the other hand is widely respected in the culture. Whenever he drops a verse or a project, people do the opposite of Drake and meme him into something that is seen as cool or funny to his advantage. I feel like I don't even need to explain how his music fits into black culture as it gives you a clear window into the life, experiences, issues, thoughts and perspectives of black people. 

The culture backing Kendrick over Drake was made very clear by the time Drake dropped the Heart Part 6.  While I do have some mixed feelings about the songs Drake dropped, Family Matters is a banger and was the one I saw being played everywhere because of how it sounded, easy to recite lyrics and melodies that could have people singing. But instead, outside of people talking about it on social media....you don't hear the song at all. And that's alarming coming from someone who is a proven hitmaker. Instead you hear Not Like Us in places you wouldn't expect and see videos of people dancing and singing along to it in clubs. 

**Summary/TLDR-** Liking Drakes diss songs more than Kendricks is subjective and I wouldn't knock anyone for their preference, but you cannot deny that Drake is a less skilled rapper, has a somewhat infamous reputation that worked against him, and lacked culture backing. For those reasons I think he lost.  Honestly, until the allegations get proven, my perception of Drake and Kendrick hasn't really changed too much. Only difference is that I can definitely say Kendrick is the #1 and Drake is the #2.

So I wanted to do some research. All of Drake's song lack use of Onomatopoeia. I even said at the start of this, I want to see something new from Drake, but I felt like we got a lot of the same Drake personally. 

**Now on Kendrick's side:**

*Euphoria- Beep Beep Beep*

*Euphoria- Bow Bow Bow*

*Not Like Us- Psst*

*Not Like Us- Emphasis on ""Pop"" out and show n\*\*\*\*\**

*Not Like Us- Wop Wop Wop*

*Not Like Us- Emphasis on ""Lean"" on you n\*\*\*\*\**

*F.A.N.- Freak A\*\* N\*\*\*\**

**Lastly, a catchy phrase for people to mock Kendrick and his fans with:**

*""OV- Hoe""*

I feel like Drake could've easily mocked Kendrick in a whole song early on with this angle and won a bit more of peoples vote early on.

Not that I feel like Kendrick solely won off this, but anyone with history in poetry circles can appreciate all the different elements of writing Kendrick uses in his music in general.

- Drake employs offenders 
- Drake is a pedophile

- Whit’s brother is supporting Kendrick 
- unconfirmed

- years of artists speaking out, the constant changing from Toronto/Latino music/Caribbean etc 
- Baka not nice getting charged with trafficking and abuse but no word on anyone else

This is a small response to the conversation about Drake's last track. A lot of people are calling out Drake for ""self-telling"" with the Millie Bobby Brown line and the Epstein line. Comments are saying ""Kendrick never said either of those names why are you bringing it up?"".

Unless you've been living under a rock, Drake's friendly relationship with MBB has been commented about heavily. Here's a thread from 3 years back making fun of that [https://www.reddit.com/r/Hiphopcirclejerk/comments/qeic0h/leaked\_chat\_between\_drake\_and\_millie/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hiphopcirclejerk/comments/qeic0h/leaked_chat_between_drake_and_millie/) There's more but I don't feel like spending too much time looking and picking threads. Drake's relationship with the 16/18yo model also goes back a while. But does anyone here know the model better than they know of MBB as a popular culture figure? I'd assume no. 

So, the MBB name-check serves two things. One, avoiding the term ""minor"" or any synonyms. The track mentions ""minor"" once only quoting the A minor chord line from Kendrick. The track mentions ""teenager"" once, says ""under age"" once, and mentions ""young"" once. I'd find ways, if I was Drake, to avoid more uses of the terms both for vocabulary variety and also to avoid those specific terms because of connotations. Second use of MBB is name-calling her specifically, as she has a platform she could be brought into the discourse and hopefully stand up for him (she did end up posting something defending him).

With the Epstein/Weinstein thing, Epstein and Weinstein did two very different things. As far as I know, both shitty humans but Weinstein was messing with adult women, Epstein was messing with not-adult women. Kendrick literally alleges him doing stuff with minors. Why name check Weinstein with that specific allegation? Sure, Kendrick said Weinstein, but the Not Like Us allegations are even more serious and name checking Epstein comes with different references.

This doesn't really change much, Drake's last track still does suck, but I feel like I need to infer this for some people who aren't reading too into things it seems.",2024-05-09 12:25:41

I’m just happy he’s finally rapping again we can disagree about the bars or whatever. But hearing rap with a purpose is refreshing. Say what you want about the man but he usually response on wax no matter who it is. Idk how you can’t respect that. 

Now on to the beef part, this is great for hip hop as it’s giving us good music(This is subjective). And the meme are hilarious. As a Stan hearing the BBL Drizzy is fucking hilarious and I hate that it sounds so good lol. Pushups was a decent record, Euphoria was good… But *meet the grahams* man Kendrick ain’t have to that man like that lol. The beat is so evil and Kendrick flow, him speaking to Dennis, Sandra and Adonis jfc man. 

Family Matters is a good response imho, He goes at everybody again. Throws out some crazy accusations of his own. And some hilarious bars I think you all know what im referring to. The Heart Part 6. Was meh at best just clearing the air over the pedo accusations with a few jabs thrown in.

I think of the worse things that can happen for an artist in a rap beef is that their opponents song becomes a radio hit and that’s what Not Like Us has become at least on the west coast. Not sure about anywhere else considering I don’t listen to radio myself. Seeing people dance and party to a diss song basically telling you. “You’re not a part of our culture” Would drive anybody mad.

All In I try to be unbiased as possible. I think both artist put out good track Kendrick showed that his penmanship should never be fucked with and Drake showed he’s willing to go toe to toe with anybody.

Drake accused Kendrick of physically abusing his long time girlfriend and that one of Kendrick’s kids may not be his. As far as I know, Kendrick hasn’t addressed either. 

Personally, I’m on the fence about Drake having a secret daughter (it wouldn’t be surprising), and his relationship with Millie back in 2014 always rubbed me the wrong way. Also the “dated SZA back in ‘08” when she would’ve turned 18 at the end of the year. I don’t know if Kendrick beat Whitney. Maybe that’s my own personal bias, but I don’t see him doing that.

She was very clear that he helps her with all sorts of problems, including relationship issues, and when asked about the topic of the relationship stuff, she said that stays in the texts with an implication that is is personal information that young girls shouldn't be talking about with random older men.

So, would you be okay with a random 30+ year old man texting your 14 year old daughter about ""relationship"" stuff?

(No I'm not touching on the beatings allegations because obviously that's horrible and nobody should be making excuses for it, nor do I see anyone defending it. And if they are they're pieces of shit too. But this ain't about that.)

“He starts off talking about people going to Compton like they are tourists. This is an interesting idea commenting on the way Drake tends to move around in spaces like Houston, Atlanta, and Compton that aren’t really his home and is treating it like a tourist pointing at things”.

Who should I listen to if I like Kendrick, NWA, and Snoop?","**Tl;dr: where should I start? My tastes are all over, but I used to love Kendrick, Childish Gambino, The Weeknd, J Cole, Kanye, and Rihanna. My mom is obsessed with Cardi B and I think I like her so far.**

I used to be that kid who kept up with the latest music. I was always introducing my friends and classmates to new artists and genres, and I spent hours after school Googling music history, playing guitar hero, watching music videos, and practicing hip hop dance after school. Even though I didn't play instruments, I understood musicality in a way that impressed people. I mean my username is even a relic of the person I used to be. Long story short, adulthood traumas killed a lot of my passions and my music knowledge (mostly with rap) got lost in 2015, and even more so when Mac Miller died.

When I heard ""Like That,"" omg I haven't felt this way in years. Listening to it is like running into an old friend. I've heard some rap songs in passing and like it, but I never know what they are and want to know. Other than ""Zeze"" and ""The Box,"" I have no idea what's going on with current rap.

The time it took him to respond if it was all apart of his plan, the lack of video/proof of him setting up the fake mole with his guys, not even a name drop or hint to said fake mole….It’s all just makes me facepalm because if this fake mole does exist, Drake went about carrying out the retaliation so poorly.

And that’s not even the worst part once you consider more lyrics in The Heart Part 6. Kendrick called him a habitual liar, to which he responds with something that’s looking more like a lie by the day (a fake mole). Kendrick said he would, “Fabricate stories on the family front cause you heard Mr Morale” to which he misinterprets Mother I Sober as Kendrick getting molested instead of his mom….

Metro and Future planned to diss Drake and contacted Kendrick (too me Drake is a better lyricist than future so that beef wouldn't last. That's why the got Dot since he is a lyrical genius and could go toe to toe with Drake) to do the Like That song. 

They planned the song to start off with Future to keep the audience from changing the song if Kendrick went first. They gave Kendrick all the info each had and why they wanted to diss Drake. And since Kendrick really doesn't like Drake he decided to be the one to cost damage to Drake's ego.They drop the like that song and Dot disses Drake and Cole. Cole responds but Kendrick tells him to chill because they wanted to lure Drake into a beef and tells him about all the things he knows and is going to say. 

Cole apologize to Dot and pulls back from the beef. Drake starts writing his response but also ""plans"" to use a decoy ""mole"" that is mutual between both camps. Drake tells the ""mole"" to ""tell Kendrick about the fake daughter"" but the ""mole"" tells Kendrick what Drake wants him to say and still gives them info about the diss, (probably shows him the picture that Kendrick used on the cover of one of his diss and video) and other things Drake does behind the scenes plus the info that probably Metro and Future gave him also. 

Drake drops Push Ups and Taylor Made talking about Kendrick being short, Ross ozempic and other shit (remember the picture because maybe Kendrick used it as his cover it was to show Drake that they knew his angle. Shirt with the shorty ""Drake dissing Kendrick for his height"" ""The ozempic for Ross"" I don't know about the pill bottles still thinking about that). Kendrick responds with Euphoria and 6:16 in LA saying (You're movin' just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin' distasteful, I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle) and (have you ever thought OVO was working for me) letting Drake know through the songs that he knows things and how everything will be played out with Drake's disses. (Kanye said in an interview that when Drake disses you he brings up things only you and him know so Kendrick uno reversed it on him)


 Drake responds with Family Matters and gets personal into Kendrick's family and other accusations. Not even 1 hour passed and Kendrick drops Meet The Graham's going at Drake's character, fatherhood and being a culture vulture with the pedo stuff. (Remember the mole gave Kendrick all the info that's why he responded so fast because he already had listing to the disses) Kendrick drops Not Like Us doubling down on the pedo stuff and being a culture vulture stealing all his style from different artists from Atlanta. But drops the narrative of the daughter.  (if you listing to Meet The Graham's there's a bar that says YOU LIED ABOUT YOUR DAUGTHER, HU. The way he said it. It was like him telling Drake I know you lied about your daughter and the fake info. Again remember what Kanye said) and shows Drake that Kendrick is the West Coast, tha the peiple will always love him and that he is hip hop and Drake is just a visitor playing a role he doesn't know anything about and just faking his way. 


Drake responds with The Heart Part 6 defending himself about the pedo allegations and telling Kendrick ""Yeah we faked that info"" (like if he was responding back to Kendricks statement of him lying about the daughter and acknowledging the ""mole"") but also says he is pretty much throwing in the towel. Maybe he is afraid of what else Kendrick could say because he did warn Drake that he had a whole lot of information on him.

The reason the Kendrake beef is a cultural moment is because it's capturing so many touchstones of contemporary culture.
Beef is now Twitterfied. Beef is now accusations with or without ""pulling receipts"". 

About halfway through, the discourse shifted away from discussing a mix of form/content to exclusively focused on the content. Both rappers are playing to our base desires of moralising the ""other"", similar to how political/religious groups function. 

The speed of the responses are exponential and both fans and artists are encouraging quick responses. Music has never felt so much more social media then RIGHT NOW. Beef started off cool but now I feel the ugliness lurking beneath has reared it's head.

https://www.reddit.com/r/rap/comments/1cng4xj/no_one_is_above_criticism/,No one is above criticism...,"THIS WILL BE A LONG POST

I didn’t know if I was going to post anything or not, because I literally never post/comment on Reddit music subs ever, but some of y’all are too fucking much.

I’m going to start out by saying, I’m a casual fan of both Kendrick and Drake’s music, but ngl, I tend to listen more to Drake. I think both men are incredibly talented musically in completely different ways (my opinion, doesn’t have to be yours). That being said, neither of these men are above criticism. We know why Drake deserves it, certainly. I’ll expand on my opinion about this in a bit, but his actions are concerning, to say the least.

However, some of (A LOT OF) y’all have Kendrick on a fucking pedestal. I see so many comments about how “he’s gonna save us from the industry” or some bullshit. Bitch, he’s *in* the industry. You think Drake is the only sus rapper he knows? This man platformed an actual child >!rapist!< (who has shown no signs of remorse or growth since) on Mr. Morale of all fucking albums, yet I’m supposed to believe his accusing Drake is in good faith? I’m supposed to believe this man cares about the welfare of children? Yeah, sure, this is the guy who’s gonna blow the industry wide open…

If he believes Drake is having sex with minors and involved in sex trafficking, why would he give him a bunch of warnings before bringing up that information and then not providing any receipts to what he’s alleging? (Drake needs to bring receipts too before I'll buy the Kendrick allegations)

I guess as long as you don’t talk about his fiancé, he’ll stay hush hush on your sex crimes. But this is y’alls king, ig.

And before you come at me with “But Drake…!”. Yeah. Shit’s weird. If he is having sex with minors, I really, really hope that shit’s exposed and he goes to fucking prison. So far though, with all the shit that’s known about Drake (the actual shit, not the Bella Harris, or the Billie Eilish ig comment that have both been debunked so many times) there isn’t anything to suggest actual sex with minors is happening. That doesn’t mean it isn’t happening. It just also doesn’t mean that it is. At most, with the evidence presented, you can accuse him of grooming and even that is really just an assumption based on how the situation looks. Assumptions aren't evidence though. Until any victims come forward, there’s no crime and you can absolutely think someone is committing a crime, but that doesn’t mean they actually are. There’s a reason we have an actual legal court system, and the court of public opinion can’t actually send anyone to jail. However, I think most of us can agree it’s concerning behavior and he absolutely deserves to be criticized for being extremely inappropriate with minors at the very least. It’s gross as fuck.

All that being said, the point I’m trying to make is, stop putting your favorite artists on pedestals (this goes for Drake fans too). Kendrick is a hypocrite that only brought this shit up to suit his own agenda and Drake is into barely legal girls. You are not morally superior for listening to Kendrick and you’re not a pedo apologist for listening to Drake. Both of them are weirdos (albeit, in different ways) and both of them make insanely good music. Listen if you want, don’t if you don’t want, but just get off your high horse, at least.

Either the music is fake, the artist’s life is totally unrelatable, the artist is concealing their true self, or the artist has not grown as a person, or some combination of these.

Drake falls in this camp, for me and I believe many others. His music for the most part does not feel in line with his stage of life and responsibilities / struggles that life has usually thrown at someone his age. People can feel the inauthenticity.

I feel the same way about Eminem. His latest music seems to offer no evolution from the angsty person he justifiably once was in his earlier years.

This is also why I think Kanye has managed to maintain his relevancy. As outlandish as many of his opinions may be, he’s open about raising daughters, his journey into religion, relationship with his dad, his mom’s death, etc. He’ll still rap about a bleached asshole, and although his music is a rollercoaster, you can still feel it’s grounded in the unpolished messiness of his life.

Is Kendrick gonna respond and actually address these claims or is he gonna concede” and I go to the internet to people calling it a bad diss, or even a white flag? Prior to him dropping, everybody said “hey man you have GOT to address the kid stuff.” Which after revealing that he faked Kendrick out—basically rendering Meet the Grahams useless—he does. Thoroughly. And then he also further doubles down on him being the father of the child and Kendrick’s alleged abuse, and then says the trauma from his mother saying he got molested when he didn’t and projecting her trauma onto him which he lives with to this day is carrying into this beef, with him being obsessed with the notion of Drake being a PDF in They Not Like Us—drawing a parallel of Kendrick’s mother simply believing what she wants to believe about Kendrick being touched as a kid to Kendrick simply believing what he wants to believe with Drake touching kids. He even ends the song with a direct call to Kendrick’s BM, saying she can hit him if she needs a favor, but when he says he’ll hit her back it’s a lot safer. 

How in the world people could say that it’s a bad diss is beyond me. The overall reaction seems so disingenuous. I watched a video of some (I’m assuming) college professor name 3 reasons why Drake’s diss failed on every level—and the second reason is genuinely the use of double negatives when saying he isn’t a PDF.

https://www.reddit.com/r/rap/comments/1cn8uhz/why_do_a_lot_of_drake_fans_push_a_narrative_that/,Why do a lot of Drake fans push a narrative that Kendrick made this beef personal and dangerous for their images,"The timeline goes Like That > Pushups > TaylorMade > Euphoria > 6.16 > Family Matters > Meet the Grahams > Not Like Us > The Heart Part 6

On Like That Kendrick makes no mention of anything personal, doesn’t even allude to it. Strictly on some competition shit with Drake and Cole. Both Drake and Cole take it personally and start saying personal shit. Drake gets on Pushups and attacks the dispute he had over his label. We all know artists get real emotional about label disputes because it affects everything about their career(Lil Uzi Vert and Megan Thee Stallion come to mind for me with how vocal they were against their labels) and warns him at the end “This ain’t everything he know don’t let the demon out” threatening Kendrick that he will take it there with no prior threats made in the same fashion against him on Like That. Cole comes at his album collection calling his last few drops not all that, but realizes his mistake about making it personal and opts out knowing what’s about to come next(Likely because KDot respects him, he gets a warning from Kendrick’s team to stay out of the way)

TaylorMade freestyle should have been his initial response without the AI shit (Though it was funny) all 3 verses should have been his. Nothing personal, pretty great bars and coming at Kendrick in a way that doesn’t provoke any of what’s going on now. I personally think had all 3 verses had been his it’d be a strong track.

Drake gets personal, Kendrick has to as well. He responds with Euphoria calling Drake a culture vulture, saying he identifies as a woman and some bars about Adonis. Personal but light stuff compared to what comes next. He even warns Drake twice let’s not go there let’s keep it strictly competitive rap. These were just warning shots. Pushups was also warning shots but were fired seemingly for no reason as again Kendrick showed no implication of going low on Like That.

Kendrick drops another warning shot of hey let’s not go there with 6.16 saying he has moles in OVO(unconfirmed whether they were real or feeders) basically warning Drake again let’s keep this rap because I know guys who know things.

And then the explosion happens: Drake drops Family Matters which is just the most personal shit of the beef so far. Doubled down on what he’s said before, calls Kendrick a woman beater and then says his child isn’t his. We all know now this was his red button and he pushed it for literally no reason after Kendrick said let’s keep this rap multiple times. Kendrick had to know this was coming likely from one of his Moles and released meet the grahams like 20 minutes later. People say the beef went dark here but no, Family Matters made it dark Kendrick just made it pitch black after being provoked. And then follows Not Like Us and Part 6. Kendrick even says in meet the grahams this was supposed to be a friendly exhibition but you had to mention my family.

From the onset of this beef Kendrick never wanted to go dark but he had the ammo and angles to take it there. This was never about just rap to Drake, he took it there from the onset in Pushups.",2024-05-08 12:28:56

https://www.reddit.com/r/rap/comments/1cn7r0a/why_is_there_so_much_hypocrisy_from_rap_fans/,"Why is there so much hypocrisy from rap fans, especially in relation to women?","I grew up in Baltimore Maryland, in High School as a Senior one of the things I had to compete the most when it came to women was 18-20 year olds who were out of school and had a job a car and some money. I found it strange at the time that it was so accepted, not to mention my thoughts on our parents circulating the R.Kelly video and how many adults at the time openly admitted to have watching it. Nevertheless if you’ve been a 17 year old boy and got the courage to pursue an attractive 17 year old girl you’ve had to compete with some 20 year old with nothing but time and money on his hands. As I got older went to college and my friend group expanded I learned this was a common experience nationwide. 

As A kid, I remember Chris Browns song Featuring Lil Wayne called Gimmie that where a 16 year old Chris sings to a 19 year old woman about having sex with her in the back of his car was huge all over America. It’s obvious he is a child and she is an adult an we all knew all the lyrics, he even mentions her liking how he makes straight A’s in school. That brings me to the reaction of 20 year old Drake on stage with a 17 year old, it feels hypocritical and I find the silence from female rap fans interesting. A lot of female rap fans had a 20 year old boyfriend at 17 they did a lot more than just kiss on stage, a lot of male rap fans had a 17 year old girlfriend at 20 because I remember being in High School. DMX who Kendrick referenced in Euphoria once said on a song “If you have a daughter older than 15 ima r*pe her” then proceeded to expound. At the time it was the wildest thing I had ever heard said on a rap song and my father who also has 3 daughters and was a huge DMX fan didn’t skip a beat. 

Judging from my extensive “Research” on The Hub’s Most Viewed videos page and IG’s explore page America has an obsession with “Teens” and young looking adult women. Now it seems like those same people are saying it’s weird for someone to date 20 year olds even tho every Rapper Athlete Actor and Single Person with a good job and no wife and kids  you know or like is doing the same thing. It seems like we as a collective fanbase are so hypocritical and we pick and choose when things are ok based on if you like who is doing it. ",2024-05-08 11:43:30

Drake has been saying in his bars how he’s going on vacation and doesn’t want to diss Kendrick anymore. All the heat is on Drake right now especially after releasing the subpar THP6 to defend against the allegations which a lot of folks believe. Plus I don’t think there’s anymore tea for Drake to spill considering he’s recycling talking points. It’s a 0 sum game for him to continue so hes going to stay out of the spotlight logically until he has an album or hit single ready.

Kendrick obviously from news sources says he has more bars for Drake however I don’t think he’ll release them for a couple reasons. The first being most everyone already thinks Kendrick won anyway it’d be superfluous if he dropped again. Second, Drakes house was shot at recently and while I don’t think Kendrick had anything to do with it if he continues dropping disses and the violence gets worse you could make the argument he’s just inciting violence on Drake at a point. Third, rumors are that Universal Music Group is involved now saying for him to squash the beef with Drake and to say he’s not a pedo. If he continues the beef that can have damning consequences to his own career and possibly a lawsuit. He could still drop but there’s more cons than pros in doing so.

I’m not mad about it though we got a lot of jams from both camps and honestly probably the most memorable rap beef in recent memory. I can’t imagine we’ll ever see anything like it again. ",2024-05-08 10:58:42

However, after diving into Drake's latest track, I couldn't help but feel that while the title was brilliant, the execution fell a bit short. But it got me thinking - what if Drake had fully realized the potential of his concept?

Remember the mind-bending visuals from ""The Hearth pt 5,"" where Kendrick's face morphed into Kanye's and others? What if Drake had used a similar technique to explore different perspectives in his hypothetical ""The Hearth pt 6""?

Here's how I envision it:

1. **Kendrick's Wife**: Imagine Drake rapping from the perspective of Kendrick's wife, delving into themes of heartbreak and alleged abuse. References to past songs like ""Opposites attract"" or ""This girl is an alien"" could add depth, painting a vivid picture of her alienation and pain.
2. **Dave Free**: Switching to a grittier beat, Drake could embody Dave Free's persona, portraying Kendrick as just a mere butterfly that he and Top Dog pimped for profits, a commodity in the music industry. This track could touch on sensitive topics like the son allegations, exposing the darker side of the industry.
3. **The Mole**: What if Drake had been the one feeding Kendrick information? Picture a duet where Drake and the mole mock Kendrick for taking the bait, adding a layer of irony and intrigue to the narrative.
4. **Kendrick's Son**: Drake could channel Kendrick's son, seeking ""poetic justice"" regarding the allegations against Dave Free. This angle could add a poignant twist, exploring the complexities of loyalty and betrayal.

While this concept is undeniably bold, it's worth considering whether it might cross certain boundaries. Some of the examples may indeed be too extreme, pushing the envelope of artistic expression.

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this hypothetical scenario. Can you imagine other ""faces"" Drake could have used to further explore this idea?

I see parallels with the Jay vs Nas beef. For me, Nas is a better ""lyrist"" but Jay makes better music and is my GOAT. Similarly, I think Drake's music has the edge (please don't downvote lol). The way he mixes bangers, singing, rapping and different melodies. I enjoy his musical IQ. Similarly, I find Kayne's lyricism weak but his musical genius puts out some of the greatest albums ever.

I sort of think about it with this analogy: I studied Shakespeare in high school and his shit was so complex he had to add words to the dictionary. In contrast, Dr Suess wrote a book with only 50 words for kids to read. At surface level, it may seem obvious that Shakespeare was the better writer but like if you dig deeper it takes complexity to dumb down stuff and Dr Suess's work is just as impressive in its own way, and not easy. 

""I dumbed down for my audience, it doubled my dollars 🤣"" 

WRT to this beef, I haven't digested it completely but there are a few things that made it almost impossible for Drake to win.

1. He was overexposed. Getting dirt on him is just too easy. The guy can't even keep his prescriptions hidden lol. He's been in public way too much. I'm a casual listener and know way too much about him already. A five minute google search and the diss writes itself. Ghostwriters, girls, family etc. In contrast, Kendrick is very private. Generally, all famous people are shit humans so I'm pretty sure Dot has some dark skeletons locked away. We just don't know cause he keeps to himself.
2. He had way too many enemies. This wasn't west vs east. Public opinion was against him before the first bar was written. It was Drake fans vs Kendrick+Ross+Meek+Future+Push+Kanye+Metro+Weeknd etc fans. He's been on top for so long that so many rooted for his downfall. All the old-heads and folks who hated his singing and background. Snitches in his circle. Most people were already biased one way.

&#x200B;

That said,  it's cool that he didn't Cole out. He gave the fans a good show despite all the headwinds. Probably one of the most exciting things in hip-hop in a while. That attitude is why he's stayed on top of the game for a decade. Constantly dropping and not afraid to jump into the booth. I think Push Ups and Family Matters were solid and underrated.

**UPDATED**: A man was hospitalized with serious injuries after a shooting outside rapper [Drake](https://variety.com/t/drake/)’s home in Toronto, according to the [CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/shooting-bayview-lawrence-1.7196240) and Toronto’s CityNews. Paramedics told reporters that the man’s injuries are not considered life-threatening; police confirmed that Drake was not the victim.

The shooting took place at around 2:10 a.m. ET near the corner of Bayview and Lawrence Avenues, Toronto police said in a brief post on X (formerly Twitter). Responding officers found a man with serious injuries; he was taken to the nearby Sunnybrook Hospital.

The [Toronto Sun](https://torontosun.com/news/local-news/warmington-drakes-security-guard-shot-outside-of-rappers-toronto-mansion) claims that the man shot was one of Drake’s security guards, but this report is unconfirmed. Contacted by *Variety,* a spokesperson for Toronto police referred to its social-media post; a rep for Drake had no comment on the situation and referred requests for further information to police.

A suspect fled in a vehicle, police said. No descriptions of either the suspect or the vehicle were provided. A police source confirmed to CBC in Toronto the ongoing investigation is centered around Drake’s home. [The streets leading to the residence were taped off](https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/police-investigation-underway-outside-drake-s-bridle-path-mansion-1.6876440) and patrol cars were seen there on Tuesday morning, according to local news reports.",2024-05-07 11:57:17

I've listed to very little rap, I'm more of a rock (all rock, classic, metal, trash, grunge, etc) and queer pop girl. 
Does anyone have any recommendations for documentaries or movies to learn more about the history of rap (I'm a history nerd) and about famous rap battles? Any youtube channel or video to learn more about rap? Any songs / albums / musicians to listen to as a beginner (I liked Kendrick more than Drake)? Any spotify playlists to recommend?
When I get obsessed with something I really get into it (when I got into F1 in 2022, I watched half the season in less than a week while watching documentaries about F1) so don't be afraid to throw a lot of info at me. I love it.",2024-05-07 00:40:16

At the end of the day why are we gonna believe Aubrey, someone who used AI imitating Tupac and leaked his first diss before that to gage public opinion so he could claim it was his, over Kendrick?

It’s always been about controlling the narrative since the beginning for Aubrey, all the Instagram stories and memes, the bait, but it was poor strategic planning as he thought he would push his red button and finish the beef - he was wrong. 

Now he’s desperately scrambling to try and keep hold of the narrative, running with Twitter theories about a fake mole that were flying around for days before he dropped THP6. If he really baited Kendrick that hard, then show the receipts straight away after MTG to get an auto W.

He was compromised and THP6 is a pathetic effort which exposes his writing flaws without ghost writers, who he no longer trusts.",2024-05-07 04:33:06

I found that i enjoy alot of vaporwave/chill edm stuff, as well as 80s-90s pop. 
I always see the cover art for Flower Boy by Tyler, the Creator so i decided to listen out of curiosity. Im now in love with his music (specifically Wolf, and the last 3 albums). I also checked out some of Earl Sweatshirt and Lil Nas X, and i love them too. So my question to you is what artists/albums should i check out for understanding and gaining an appreciation for the genre?

Like idk how to explain bit his instrumentals are too sharp. Like ringing a bell or the high-note chipmunk voices... Like it's a lot.

If that is true then:

1. Why did Kenny know EXACTLY when Drake was dropping a diss, and knew he was going after his family


2. Why was he completely blindsided by it, he SHOULD HAVE BEEN READY, mf was so defensive over the daughter shit. Instead of laughing it off and instantly spinning back on Kendrick.


3. Why the fuck would you even feed someone information that gave you an L in your last beef, that would be some dumb sf shit to do

And don't even get me started on the Pedo & molestation spin, tyat shit was so weird, and don't even make sense in context to what Kendrick actually said in Mr. Morale

Plus he completely ignored other serious allegations, like being a colonizer and having sex offenders on his payroll.

https://www.reddit.com/r/rap/comments/1clvzqd/drakes_beef_with_kendrick_possibly_linked_to/,Drake's beef with Kendrick possibly linked to previous beef with XXXtentacion,"Everyone knows a lot about the beef between Drake and Kendrick, and most people know about the allegations that Drake had some involvement in the killing of XXXtentacion. I started to do some digging because I felt like it, and I found some interesting stuff.

For those who don't know the allegations of Drake being involved in the killing of XXXtentacion, I'll explain here.

The beef between XXX and Drake started when XXX went on a radio show in March of 2017, where he called Drake a bitch multiple times and alleged that Drake stole the flow from ""Look at Me"" on the song KMT.

In February of 2018, XXX posted on his insta story saying ""If anyone tries to kill me it was Drake"".(XXX later said that his account was hacked)

Later on in the song ""On BS"", drake uses the line ""Maybe I should do a 20, maybe I should break that 20, do a 10. Maybe I should break that 10, do a 5, then if it gets live, do a 5 again. If he held his tongue on that live he'd be alive again."" In Roman numerals, X is the number 10. Breaking the twenty would result in 10(X) and 10(X). Then the two 5s are added together to make another 10(X). From those you get XXX, and we know that XXX was talking about Drake on a live. This hints at Drake playing a role in his death.

Throughout this whole beef, Kendrick was a big supporter of XXX, even listening to his debut album 17 multiple times and saying on Twitter ""listen to this album if you feel anything. raw thoughts."". Kendrick also said that if XXX were still alive, he would be right up there with Drake, J. Cole, and himself. So clearly Kendrick has the utmost respect and love for XXX, which is why I think it might play a part in the beef.

The first of the last 2 parts, which I'll admit are a bit of a stretch, is the final line in ""Meet the Grahams"", where Kendrick says ""Fuck a rap battle, this a long life battle with yourself"". This could be saying there is more to the beef than just what has been said recently, and that it could stem from Drakes's alleged part in the killing of XXX.

The other last part, which is less of a stretch, comes from a line Kendrick wrote in ""Not Like Us"" where he says ""one, two, three, four, five, plus five"". The five plus five part could have a similar meaning to the previous point, with adding the 5 and the 5 to get 10(X).

Now I'm not saying that this is the only thing the beef is about, but I think this might be something that is playing into the battle as well. Feel free to let me know what you think regardless of if you agree or not!",2024-05-06 18:23:19

People are so deep in that they believe Whitney owes them an explanation when she doesn’t. Especially when Kendrick never intended on bringing her into this situation. 

The difference between Drake and Kendrick is that Drake alleged admiration for young girls has been a topic for several years now and it’s something he needed to address based on his own actions in the past. There’s nothing to suggest that Kendrick beat his significant other or that his co-worker and friend  is the father of his hold. And I don’t know why people believe Drake either.

Just genuinely curious if anyone actually thinks that would be a good look on Drake? I’ve seen people talk about whether or not it’s true, but if we assume it is, is it impressive and a “win”?",2024-05-06 18:27:03

• saying you're too famous to be a pedophile and if you were fucking young girls you'd be in jail is an insane thing to say considering all the rich powerful famous people we've seen get away with that shit. We are seeing it go down right now with diddy

• the Mother I Sober thing was weird because essentially you're making fun of someone for being molested which is a bad look in the midst of being accused of being a predator. But even worse is the story of that song is Kendrick saying the exact opposite! Drake dropped a bar telling Kendrick he had to do his proper research and then either didn't listen to mother I sober or completely misinterpreted it Imao. Being accused of being a predator and your two main responses being “I’m too famous to be a predator” and “haha you got molested that’s why you hate predators” are two terrible angles of defense !!

•all that looks some type of way too when you remember the line “I can even predict your angles, fabricatin stories on the family front cause you heard mr morale”

•he didn’t address the colonizing Atlanta angle literally at all 

• lastly his delivery and voice just sound so tired and done with this and between that and the outro essentially saying he's done is a huge white flag and it’s just funny because he was BEGGING Kendrick to drop on Taylor made and now he’s like “alright I’m done you’re doing to much”",2024-05-06 17:41:54

Drop pushups (decent diss)

Then drop Taylor Made to goad Kendrick into a response (but also try’s to 8 mile pedo allegations, also hypocritical because of how long it took him to respond to Like That)

Let Kendrick go back to back on him 

leak an image to Kendrick of his own personal belongings including prescription pills with his name on them (which implies Drake got an Ozempic prescription just to leak it to Kendrick) along with allegations that he has an 11 year old daughter 

Drop Family Matters (decent diss) 

Let Kendrick drop 20 minutes after which completely overshadows him (which has a very similar title and theme to family matters, which makes the planned leak thing seem like a lie) 

THEN rather than immediately have proof that he set Kendrick up, he writes an IG caption and then tries to say he’s going on vacation 

Only for Kendrick to go back to back on him AGAIN and openly call him a p on a fucking club track 

Rather than shut that down immediately with a statement or ANYTHING he waits and lets that linger 

Then answers back with the Heart part 6, which is filled with contradictions and he also openly misinterprets one of Kendrick’s songs and uses a song as a basis for his allegations (even though Drake has multiple questionable lyrics) and in doing so tries to use Kendrick being Molested as a gotcha moment and mocks his mom for being molested. AND inadvertently misconstrues a song about inter-generational trauma (which further plays into Drake isn’t with black culture) 

He then brings up Millie Bobby brown and Jeffery Epstein even though no one had brought them up yet 

And his main Defense argument is “I’m too rich and famous to be a pedo” (R Kelly, Diddy etc etc)

Then goes on to ask why Whitney hasn’t come out against the allegations yet (even though no one in the music industry has come out in defence of Drake) 

Then finishes it out by claiming he knew about the mole and in doing so calls HIMSELF a clown???? So he just let his name get slandered on and gave those rumours time to breathe….on purpose? 

So even it’s true that he planted the leak and that he doesn’t have a daughter (which it obviously isn’t because he doesn’t have any proof of his “masterplan”) 

What a fucking stupid roll-out, like the way he went about revealing the “truth” makes it looks less believable because of how fucking dumb it is. 
Even if the Drake allegations are false (even though they’re more grounded in reality than the Kendrick allegations) 
Kendrick has managed to make Drake look like a fucking dumbass

The only way Drake wins are if the allegations against him are false and the ones against Kendrick are true (and I highly doubt that as an outcome let’s be real)

I’ve seen a lot of talk about drakes “misinterpretation” of mother I sober. I interpret the song the same way drake does, that kendrick was actually molested and he wasn’t believed when he denied it. Kendrick says “never lied, but nobody believed me when I said HE didn’t”, this isn’t a denial of what happened it’s a denial of the culprit. Kendrick is apparently very intentional with his words so it makes no sense to frame it this way if nothing actually went down.

 He also starts the track by saying “secrets that I hide buried in these words” he’s telling the audience that what they see on the surface of this song isn’t what actually went down. He also mentions his uncle after saying his cousin wasn’t the culprit. “Mothers brother says he got revenge for my mothers face” this could be taken as an admission of who actually did it, kendrick blames himself for what happened to his mum, maybe his uncle blames him too and did some sick shit in revenge? All of this makes it seem like that kendrick was actually abused as a child. 

Also drake bringing that song up is very tactical, kendrick references mother I sober on like that “chains and tattoos”, he also claims at the end of mother I sober that he broke the generational curse of hurt. What drake is truly saying is that he failed to do so, he hurt Whitney, he’s an absent father to his real child and hates the one that isn’t his. And all that guilt is what is making kendrick lash out baselessly on him, desperate for people to believe him now, because nobody did back then.",2024-05-06 13:01:50

Like, bro. Creating a fantasy where you imagine your opponent being molested as a kid is bad enough. That is sexual perversion. Then putting that in a song, after being accused of being a sexual pervert, and releasing it. When your opponent literally has a song called Mother I Sober where he talks about how he *wasn't* molested. 

And dude, 

Drake, you had me actually leaning in to listen when you said your mother came over. I wanted to hear that you and your mom talked. That you cool. That you listened to her. That maybe you will change your ways. 

Nobody you expected you to pivot into some poorly researched/intentionally misleading story that in no ways treats the subject matter with respect...

1st Quarter 

Like that - TD. 7 points 

Easily a banger and had EVERYONE talking 

I believe 21 days went by, and the first quarter ends with Kendrick up by 7. 

2nd Quarter 

Push ups - TD 7 points 

Taylor Made - Field Goal 3 points 

Push-ups lands solid. 
Taylor made was not the gut shot that it should have been. Drake lost cred by using AI. 

There's no activity for a while and we go to Half Time with Drake up 10 - 7. 

HALF TIME. 


3RD QUARTER 

Euphoria - TD 7 

6:16 in LA -  TD 7 

Back to back TDs by Kendrick 

We start the 4th Quarter with Kendrick up 24 -10. 

What a turn of events. 

4TH QUARTER 

Family Matters - TD 7 

24-17 Kdot 

Drake drops a solid banger. 

While the Drake camp his handing out high fives Kendrick drops meet the Grahams and takes the ensuing kick of in for a TD, instantly killing the OVO momentum. 

Meet the Grahams TD 7 

31 - 17 Kdot 

Seemingly not happy the lead Kendrick drops again and score easily with not like us. 

Not Like Us TD 7 

38 - 17 Kdot 


Drakes camp and his fans are in despair. 

Rightfully so. Not Like us us easily a banger and Seemingly puts the game out of reach.

The Heart Pt 6 - TD 7 

Drake needed to score more points but did not release enough songs to keep pace with Kendrick later in the game. 

The game ends 38 - 24.

I’m 31 and right now I’d say that the beef has spiraled into so much personal gossip and allegations that it somehow is boring musically. Do they make for great headlines? Absolutely. Do I refresh constantly to see if there’s any updates? Of course. Here’s my issue, meet the grahams & the heart part 6 are terrible songs. The concept of MTGS is incredible and executed amazing, but this is not something I want to play on repeat in the car. 

The highlights from both sides are 

Like That vs Push Ups 
Euphoria vs Family Matters. 

Family Matters gets a lot of hate because of the timing of the Kenny drop but I think it’s the best rapping we’ve heard from Drake in 5 years. 

So please, if you’re over the age of 25 and don’t want to gargle either or these men, please share your opinion. To the younger fans I salute you but when Jay bombed on Nas, Nas fans said he might be done and when Ether came out Jay fans said it was over. ",2024-05-06 09:34:11

Drake lied and said Kendrick talked about how he was touched on ""Mother I Sober"" but Literally in the song Kendrick talks about how he WASN'T touched but his mother didn't believe him because she had been SAd herself.

Being accused of being a P and then using a misinterpretation of a song to say ""this guy just doesn't like Ps because he was affected by one so his opinion on me doesn’t matter."" is a CRAZY way to go about it.

Also, Drake said the ones feeding Kendrick the info are clowns but then says they planned on feeding him the info... that he has a daughter, that he is a deadbeat and that he is a P??? Ooo you got him there Drake. I just don't believe Drake set it up. It doesn't make sense to bait someone into ruining your reputation and act like you did it on purpose. I call cap.

Essentially what’s happend is Drake & Kendrick have desperately found dirt to throw at eachother in the hope that something sticks. 

Drakes ‘red button’ was that Kendrick allegedly beat his wife 

He thinks this is it. The killer blow. And it should be tbf. 

But he’s bloated the track with bars for a bunch of other n***as he didn’t need to even speak on aaannd then Kendrick drops **meet the grahams** +  immediately stepped on the family matters hype 

So people are talking about Drakes supposed daughter more than Kendricks alleged DA 

The plan backfires and Kendrick then claims Drake has a daughter - surely not right ?? 😱😱😱also calls him a sex trafficker. 

Then Drake, for some amazing reason, after having *“fed Kendrick misinformation”* - didn’t have a track ready to drop  ? 

And decides…to make a post on IG…Jesus.  

So Kendrick releases another one but this time it’s a club banger in which he calls drake and co pedophiles. 

Drake then simultaneously wins and loses the whole shit with his next move.  

He has the killer blow ready right. It was all false - he’s got this n***a where he wants him right? Time for some 4pm in [enter here] type bars to BURY this ni**a 

**Nope.** 

He delivers the 2nd sleepiest song in this whole shit in which :

He reveals he gave Kendrick false info 👍

He goes harder on the domestic abuse and Dave Free baby angle 👍 👍

But to defend himself he not only completely mis quotes the song mother i by Kenny- he  also…

Brace yourself…

He, fucking, tries to use the angle that **Kendrick Lamar was molested…so THAT is why he’s calling Drake a pedophile**

…👎

Not only does he misinterpret ‘mother I’ here but - I mean that’s also just not the angle. 

Then after inexplicably bringing up Millie Bobbie brown (who Kendrick didn’t mention)

He tries to flip the a minor bar that everyone’s been singing in the clubs on the west coast and for the first time - 

Drake **completely** fails at flipping a bar with a horrible b sharp bar 

Then at the end says he’s done with the beef but is also waiting on Kendrick ..? 

And now we’re told Kendrick may be done with the beef.  

⚫️We have literally 0 real proof of anything either men have said 

⚫️I’m 1000% sure Drake doesn’t have a daughter - Kendrick never mentions this again.

⚫️Drake saying he’s never fucked with teenagers but there’s videos going round 

⚫️Kendrick not once denies beating OR cheating on his wife ..? 

⚫️however Whitney’s brother publicly supports Kendrick on Twitter which makes it look like him beating Whitney isn’t true either. 

⚫️Drake never denies using Atlanta for money or the fake abs or why he’s been connected to a bunch of 16 year olds 


And now apparently atleast 1 of them is walking away from the beef. Crazy. 

So nothing said was true and we got maybe 2-4 decent tracks out of this whole fuckery that are filled with bullshit anyway. ",2024-05-06 02:54:34

1. He denied sending a Cease and Desist (for Like That and his feature on Mac n Cheese 5), yet both Metro and Rick Ross came with receipts proving that to be false.

2. He said KDot is a fake activist who’s never down anything for his city, yet all you need to do is do a quick Google search to see this is false. Kendrick gives back to his community he just avoids publicity. 

3. He denied ever looking at a teenager twice on the Heart Part VI, but there’s faaarrrrr too much evidence over the years to show that this is false.

4. This one is kind of a stretch on my end, but Drake claimed to have been the mastermind behind the “fake” mole and planted false information for Kendrick Lamar to use in Meet the Grahams and knew what his response would be.

Kendrick successfully sold the narrative that he’s connected to a mole in OVO because he dropped Meet the Grahams not even an hour after Family Matters, and the title of the song was clearly a reference to Drake’s.

So far the only thing Kendrick may have been dishonest about was the line about Drake smashing Wanye’s girl while he was in prison( Wayne said it happened before he dated her), but that was likely a case of stretching the truth for a reaction. I hope both sides come with receipts, and that this beef settles already -but if no receipts are provided then I’m going to have to go with Kendrick’s narrative over Drake’s.",2024-05-06 00:27:48

But I remebered differently. 

**Family ties, they accused my cousin
""Did he touch you Kendrick?""
Never lied, but no one believed me when I said ""He didn't""
Frozen moments, still holding on it
Hard to trust myself, I started rhyming
Coping mechanisms to lift up myself**

So... did I miss something?

I'm not a native speaker so maybe I didn't get the bar that Drake is talking about. Is it in another track?

I have a lot to say.. This is bigger than rap

I'm conflicted right now because I've been watching pedophiles get caught on camera, (and not just “To Catch a Predator”, more of random civilians and vigilante groups,) since 2018 and they all react the same way. They all change their demeanor entirely they all get very defensive and quiet and low-key. That’s how drake’s responding right now. I can link videos from many different groups and even to catch a predator to see how they all react the same exact way and say the same things like a script; blue collar workers, educators, politicians, celebrities, both genders and sometimes multiple people at once and Drake is acting just how they all do. In reality, there’s nothing you can do to defend yourself besides saying I didn't do it and it’s my first time.(I know Drake didn’t say the 2nd phrase) But with how he responded it really just makes me feel like it's true. The video of him kissing the 17 year old on stage (yes that’s above age of consent but he’s in his late 20s in this video, still weird and it way too sensual) and the sexual assault case he paid 500k+ to are real receipts that show maybe he’s not innocent.

Another thing with the mole and the daughter being a set up, if that was true then why did he respond how he responded right after family matters and meet the grahams dropped ? 20 minutes later on his Instagram story he says oh if I have a daughter send her to me and then he went to Ak while he was streaming and he said I'll quit rap and work for whoever finds his daughter if it’s true. If this was a set up then why would you respond like that ? You wouldn't, you’d wait until the diss track and then drop the nuke that this was a setup. I saw 1 page hint at the fact this was a setup on twitter yesterday or early today. (5/5/24)

I'm not saying Kendrick can't get played, but I feel like Kendrick is street smart enough, although I don’t know him personally, (and honestly anyone should have enough common sense) to not take info and jump on it from someone on Drake’s PAYROLL that’s this damaging to him. For this to have worked and Kendrick to take this bait; it has to come from someone in drakes camp that’s been a “mole” for Kendrick for a very long time. Meaning if this “mole” is a “double agent,” (and come on are we in a movie or something this is kinda ridiculous) Drake would’ve have to been planning this for a very long time. Since before he got Cole on first person shooter. He would’ve had to think that because himself and Cole were going to sub Kendrick that it would entice a response to then respond himself to then get Kendrick to drop these “fake informations,” to then drop the bomb that it was a setup ? Maybe the cover art was a setup but I HIGHLY doubt anything other than that was Drake’s plan. This would've had been such an intricate, James Bond level plot.

I think he's lying. I know how pedophiles react to these accusations. I've been watching these videos for six years now. Drake sounds like he feels very disappointed and sad, I think he got caught. He's being exposed right now. He's a criminal if that's the case but if you know anything about the punishment for these crimes that people, especially people of Drake’s stature, receive, you know nothing or not much of anything will come of this. It’ll be swept under the rug SOMEHOW and someway and then Drake drops a Grammy nominated album and maybe even wins.

This is now deeper than hip hop. Whether Drake is guilty of this or not, Hollywood and governments around the world have been involved in child sex trafficking for generations beyond the social media common eras. The one thing I’m linking to this video is a documentary I feel everyone needs to watch. Please take the time to watch it in its entirety before saying anything else about it. Even take the religion aspect out of it if you must. Know that at all times we’re being played and lied to and we need to realize this. Lord have mercy on us all.

5 minutes & 26 seconds of Drake going ""nuh uh!"" No real rebuttal, no receipts, nothing new to add, just more shots in the dark based off Twitter & Reddit theories. 

Drake messed up on so many of his lines, you can tell this was rushed. There's so many examples I can go off of, like how he misunderstood what Kdot was saying in ""Mother I Sober"" about the molestation. It was clearly explained that Kdot wasn't molested, & instead the constant questioning is what traumatized him. 

Drake also just straight up implied that he's too famous to be a pedophile. Explaining how he's too famous to be messing with underage girls or else he'd be arrested by now? What kind of logic is that!? As well as saying ""I knew you were gonna compare me to Epstein!"" Bro... that's not something to brag about. 😭

""I don't wanna diss you anymore, you got me second guessing"" pretty much means he's waving the white flag. 

This isn't a diss... this is self defense. Kdot got Drake explaining himself, sounding defeated, monologuing. + All this over a mid ass beat? C'mon man, do better.

The only option I see if he still wants to make music people listen to is to go underground for a hot second, not have any other negative publicity AT ALL, become a better role model w/out putting it on blast and finally when he does have the perfect opening for a revival, come with something so HOT it has anyone who listens to music, no matter genre (Rap fans, R&B fans, Jazz fans, Soul fans, Rock fans, Country fans, etc.) jamming it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/rap/comments/1ckzy4e/jayz_eminem_tupac_top_3_go_in_kendrick_lamars/,"[Jay-Z, Eminem, Tupac- Top 3, Go!] In Kendrick Lamar’s Apple Music interview, they discuss Jay Z, Eminem, and Tupac as being three significant influences on Kendrick Lamar, each for three distinct reasons. What are their best songs? ","Maybe let’s each put down a top 3 for each artist, so 9 total with an optional bonus for features. I’ll admit, I am posting this because in terms of golden age, I always leaned Biggie, and also Jay Z never quite landed for me either. I loved Eminem when I was younger, but have not really been motivated to reconnect with his stuff in years. So, this requires a think for me too, and I’m hoping your responses will help me better appreciate these guys. 

If possible, organize your top 3 around the criteria Kendrick Lamar isolates as what made these rappers distinctly influential. Jay-Z had a handle on making his flow feel conversational. Eminem had a handle on twisting language and making words rhyme that you wouldn’t expect. Tupac was doing something important for the culture, giving back to the community, and using rap to do something important like beyond just entertainment. Okay, here’s mine, to model the response structure

Jay- Z
1. Is That Yo Bitch 
2. D’Evils
3. Can I Get A…

Bonus: Favorite feature - Diamonds from Sierra Leone - Remix by Kanye West

Eminem
1. Brain Damage
2. The Real Slim Shady
3. Without Me

Bonus: Favorite feature - Forgot About Dre by Dr. Dre

Tupac
1. Dear Mamma
2. Changes
3. Hail Mary

Bonus: Favorite feature - Smile by Scarface

Bonus Top 3 - Favorite Kendrick Lamar
1. m.A.A.d city
2. HUMBLE.
3. Swimming Pools (Drank)

Bonus: Favorite feature - F**kin’ Problems by A$AP Rocky
